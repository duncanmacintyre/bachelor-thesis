%

\usepackage{caption}
\usepackage{subcaption}

\usepackage{framed}

\usepackage{cancel}

% package for boxing multi-line equations
\usepackage{empheq}

%******** afterpage ***************************
% This package allows you to issue commands at the end of the current
% page.  A good use for this is to use the command
% \afterpage{\clearpage} right after a figure.  This will cause the
% figure to be inserted on the page following the current one (or on
% the current page if it will fit) but will not break the page in the
% middle.
\usepackage{afterpage}
\usepackage{xcolor}
%******** float *********************************
% This package allows you to customize the style of
% "floats"---floating objects such as figures and tables.  In
% addition, it allows you to define additional floating objects which
% may be included in a list similar to that produces by \listoftables
% and \listoffigures.  Common uses include introducing floats for
% programs and other code bits in Compute Science and Chemical Schema.
\usepackage{float}
\usepackage{amsmath,amssymb,bm}
%******** tocloft *******************************
% This package allows you to customize and define custom lists such
% as a list of programs or Chemical Scheme.  Note: if you use the
% subfigure package, you must specify that you do as an option here.
% The title option uses the default formatting.  We do not use this
% here as the default formatting is acceptable.  Use the float
% package instead unless you need the extra formatting control
% provided by tocloft.
%\usepackage[subfigure, titles]{tocloft}

%******** alltt *********************************
% The alltt package allows you to include files and have them
% formatted in a verbatim fashion.  This is useful for including
% source code from an additional file.
%\usepackage{alltt}

%******** listings ******************************
% The listings package may be used to include chunks of source code
% and has facilities for pretty-printing many languages.
%\usepackage{listings}

%******** longtable *****************************
% The longtable package allows you to define tables that span
% multiple pages.



\usepackage{longtable}

%******** graphics and graphicx *****************
% This allows you to include encapsulated postscript files.  If you
% don't have this, comment the \includegraphics{} line following the
% comment "%includegraphics" later in this file.
\usepackage{graphicx}

%******** subfigure *****************************
% The subfigure package allows you to include multiple figures and
% captions within a single figure environment.
%\usepackage{subfigure}

%******** here **********************************
% The here package gives you more control over the placement of
% figures and tables.  In particular, you can specify the placement
% "H" which means "Put the figure here" rather than [h] which means
% "I would suggest that you put the figure here if you think it looks
% good."
%\usepackage{here}

%******** pdflscape ********************************
% This allows you to include landscape layout pages by using the
% |landscape| environment.  The use of |pdflscape| is preferred over
% the standard |lscape| package because it automatically rotates the
% page in the pdf file for easier reading.  (Thanks to Joseph Shea
% for pointing this out.)
\usepackage{pdflscape}

%******** natbib ********************************
% This is a very nice package for bibliographies.  It includes options
% for sorting and compressing bibliographic entries.
\usepackage[numbers,sort&compress]{natbib}
%\usepackage{natbib}   % omit 'round' option if you prefer square brackets

%\usepackage{hyperref}

% for clever referencing, i.e. references equations as e.g.: eq. (1.1), particularly useful together with hyperref (which is automatically loaded by jcappub)

%******** psfrag ******************************
% This allows you to replace text in postscript pictures with formated
% latex text.  This allows you to use math in graph labels
% etc. Uncomment the psfrag lines following the "%psfrag" comment
% later in this file if you don't have this package.  The replacements
% will only be visible in the final postscript file: they will be
% listed in the .dvi file but not performed.
%\usepackage{psfrag}
%\usepackage[margin=0.5in]{geometry}
%******** hyperref *****************************
% Please read the manual:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/manual.html
%
% This adds hyperlinks to your document: with the right viewers (later
% versions of xdvi, acrobat with pdftex, latex2html etc.) this will
% make your equation, figure, citation references etc. hyperlinks so
% that you can click on them.  Also, your table of contents will be
% able to take you to the appropriate sections.  In the viewers that
% support this, the links often appear with an underscore.  This
% underscore will not appear in printed versions.
%
% Note: if you do not use the hypertex option, then the dvips driver
% may be loaded by default.  This will cause the entries in the list
% of figures and list of tables to be on a single line because dvips
% does not deal with hyperlinks on broken lines properly.
%
% NOTE: HYPERREF is sensitive to the ORDER in which it is LOADED.
% For example, it must be loaded AFTER natbib but BEFORE newly
% defined float environments.  See the README file with the hyperref
% for some help with this.  If you have some very obscure errors, try
% first disabling hyperref.  If that fixes the problem, try various
% orderings.
%
% Note also that there is a bug with versions before 2003/11/30
% v6.74m that cause the float package to not function correctly.
% Please ensure you have a current version of this package.  A
% warning will be issued if you leave the date below but do not have
% a current version installed.
%
% Some notes on options: depending on how you build your files, you
% may need to choose the appropriate option (such as [pdftex]) for the
% backend driver (see the hyperref manual for a complete list).  Also,
% the default here is to make links from the page numbers in the table
% of contents and lists of figures etc.  There are other options:
% excluding the [linktocpage] option will make the entire text a
% hyperref, but for some backends will prevent the text from wrapping
% which can look terrible.  There is a [breaklinks=true] option that
% will be set if the backend supports (dvipdfm for example supports
% it but does not work with psfrag.)
%
% Finally, there are many options for choosing the colours of the
% links.  These will be included by default in future versions but
% you should probably consider changing some now for the electronic
% version of your thesis.
%\usepackage[unicode=true,
%  linktocpage,

\begin{abstract}                %% Mandatory -  maximum 350 words

When a small perturbation \(\lambda \op{V}\) is added to a Hamiltonian \(\op{H}_0\), the Von Neumann entropy of a subsystem may change as a result. I study this change in entropy. In particular, I derive a general expression for the change in entropy based on perturbative corrections to the eigenvalues of the reduced density operator. It shows that the entropy of a mixed state will never decrease provided (1) there exist component states with zero initial probability that can be transitioned into and (2) initial component states do not have lower-order corrections to their probabilities than states with zero initial probability. I also derive an expression for the change in entropy for what I call ``diagonally separable states'' (which include product states) that can transition into states with zero initial probability in the accessible space. For such systems, the change in entropy depends only on the transition amplitudes to states with zero initial probability. I consider two simple examples applying my results and speculate on future directions.

\end{abstract}



% This causes the Lay Summary to be on the same page as the abstract and not appear in the table of contents
%\subsubsection{Lay Summary}
\chapter{Lay Summary}

%[Required, Maximum 150 words]

%This is a simple summary of your thesis, written so that members of the public will get some idea about what you have done.

%Full-sky simulations of the foreground radiation of the cosmic microwave background are computationally expensive and it is challenging to measure if they can replicate the same statistical properties as the real data. 
%In this thesis, I advocate for the use of a method called the ``hierarchical wavelet coefficients" for characterizing non-Gaussianities in a spherical field. This method is also known as the ``wavelet scattering transform" method and so far it has been mostly used for analysing flat (cutsky) maps. I demonstrate that the full-sky implementation introduced in this thesis is also capable of characterizing non-Gaussianities using a small set of coefficients.  

%The algorithm for this method is based on the  \textsc{Healpy} package. 

%I demonstrate that we can check the non-Gaussianity in simulated maps. I propose that this method can potentially serve as a tool for measuring and controlling the amount of non-Gaussianity in future simulations. 
In quantum mechanics, two systems can be fundamentally entwined through a process called entanglement. We may wish to quantify the amount of entanglement---we can do so through something called ``entanglement entropy.’’ I study how this entanglement entropy changes over time. I derive several formulae for entanglement entropy in different cases of initial conditions. I also develop conditions under which entanglement entropy may never decrease.

\chapter{Acknowledgements}      %% Optional
I would like to thank Gordon Semenoff for being a superb supervisor. I have learnt much from him. The general approach taken in this thesis was his suggestion and subsequent work benefitted much from his guidance and advice.

I would also like to thank Panos Betzios for his feedback as well as Kang Choi for our many conversations.
