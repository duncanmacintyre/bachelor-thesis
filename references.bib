abstract = {Entropy has played an essential role in the history of physics. Its mathematical definition and applications have changed over time till today. In this paper, we first review the historical evolution of these various points of view, from the thermodynamic definition to information entropy from Shannon in classical physics, up to the modern concept of Neumann’s quantum entropy. As a specific example, we consider entanglement entropy and compare the phase space approach in classical physics to the Hilbert space approach in quantum physics in simple model systems. We derive a general expression for the entanglement entropy of fermions and bosons in arbitrary partitions of Hilbert space, valid beyond the thermodynamic limit. Next, we compare thermodynamic heat engines with quantum heat engines. Finally, we proceed to the more general concept of quantum (computational) complexity and argue, using the concept of entanglement entropy, that the Heisenberg time in classically chaotic systems coincides with the time when maximal complexity is reached in the quantum case for systems with all–all interactions.}

After a careful review and analysis of definitions, of preliminary results, and of connections between conditions on entanglement measures, we prove a sharpened version of a uniqueness theorem which gives necessary and sufficient conditions for an entanglement measure to coincide with the reduced von Neumann entropy on pure states. We also prove several versions of a theorem on extreme entanglement measures in the case of mixed states. We analyze properties of the asymptotic regularization of entanglement measures proving, for example, convexity for the entanglement cost and for the regularized relative entropy of entangle ment.}",
